Hi! I am Syed Abdul Rehman aka stdnoerr. I am interested in Low Level Vulnerability Research and Exploit Development of Linux and Android.

I am a Computer Science Gradute from [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](https://uet.edu.pk/home/) (Class 2021). I have been working at [Ebryx (Pvt.) Ltd](https://www.ebryx.com/) as a Security Researcher for 4 years.

At Ebryx, I have conducted Android exploitation research, Vulnerability Researcher of products, Malware Development with AV/EDR evasion and Security Research of Java Deserialization vulnerabilities.<br/>
For my own research, I like to develop n-day exploits for Linux Kernel vulnerabilities and play CTFs. I mostly play with either [ARESx](https://aresxcyber.github.io/) or [AirOverflow](https://team.airoverflow.com/).

In CTFs, I have won PCSC 2023, won PUCon CTF 2024, placed 3rd in PCSC 2024 and played BlackHat MEA 2024 in Riyadh.

Aside from Security, I enjoy socializing, watching movies (favourite genre Action, Thriller and Science fiction), working on personal growth and learning about any topic the YouTube algorithm suggests.

Cheers!
